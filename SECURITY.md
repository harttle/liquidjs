# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest major version is supported with security updates. It can be changed if many people are relying on a specific version for some reason. If this is the case, welcome to file an issue.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please contact yangjvn@126.com to report a vulnerability.

- It will be fixed very soon (maybe within 1 week or couple of days) if that vulnerability obviously affects common use cases.
- Otherwise, it'll be scheduled with a priority just like requested features (which is lower than bugs).
- If it's declined, you'll receive an email (more oftenly there will be a discuss).
