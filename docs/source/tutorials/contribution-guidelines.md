## Show Me Your Code

**Code Style**: LiquidJS applies [standard](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard) and [@typescript-eslint/recommended](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin/src/configs/recommended.json) rules, make sure it's still valid before commit:

```bash
npm run lint
```

**Testing**: Make sure test cases pass with your patch merged:

```bash
npm test
```

**Commit Message**: Please align to [the Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits), especially note the [type identifier](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#type), on which semantic-release bot depends.
