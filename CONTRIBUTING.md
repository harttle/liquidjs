# Contributing

1. Build everything and run tests to learn how to do both:
  - `npm run build:dist`
  - `npm run test`

  Tests won't at first unless you've done a build at least once.
  Subsequent changes to tests do not need re-builds but changes to the code and
  then tests need a build to pick up the new code by the tests.

2. Make your changes and add a test for them
  - Build after you've made your changes
  - Run tests as per the above to validate your changes

3. Create a pull request
  - Ensure the build runs because the Husky pre-commit hook checks it
  - `git switch -c your_branch_name` (do this in your fork not the main repo)
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "feat: Adding my change"`
  - `git push`
  - Go to GitHub and find your fork, open a PR against the upstream from it
